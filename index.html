    <h2>Candle Picture</h2>
    <p><a></a></p>
    <p>This picture was one of the first pictures I was able to make using code. I used elements such as RGB and shapes to create it. I also found out how to dim or make a light brighter which created the glowing candle effect. One of the challenges I faced was creating the candle’s shadow, as I wasn’t very good with overlapping shapes but I eventually got over it.</p>

    <h2>Polygon Generator</h2>
    <p><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/898515636"></a></p>
    <p>A partner and I coded this game to draw different polygons based on size and location. At first, this was a difficult task and it seemed much more complex than it was actually. We eventually figured out that the main idea behind the game would be to find a formula that could calculate the outside angles of each polygon simply based on the amount of slides it has. Once we figured this out we were able to apply it to every polygon, the only difference we had to make in the code was the angle that we would turn the sprite. It was interesting seeing how math and coding go together.</p>
